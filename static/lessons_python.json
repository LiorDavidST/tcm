It emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners and professionals alike. Python is used in web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.\nLearning Python opens many doors due to its simple syntax, extensive libraries, and strong community support.",

Some common ones are: int (Integer): Whole numbers, like 5, -3, or 100. float (Floating point): Numbers with a decimal, like 3.14, -0.5, or 100.0. complex: Numbers with a real and imaginary part, like 2 + 3j. str (String): Text or characters, written with quotes like 'Hello' or 'A'. bool (Boolean): True or False values — used for decisions in code.",
